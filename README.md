## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the chatbot locally on your computer.

### **Prerequisites**
- A modern web browser (**Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari**).
- A text/code editor (**VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.**) if you want to customize it.
- (Optional) A local HTTP server for testing.

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Uzakun/Chatbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Chatbot
   ```

3. **Run the chatbot**:
   - **Option 1:** Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
   - **Option 2:** Run a local server (for better performance):
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```
     Then open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

## 📝 How It Works
1. The **user enters a message** in the chat input.
2. The **JavaScript script (`script.js`) processes the input**.
3. The chatbot **matches the input** to predefined responses.
4. The **response is displayed** in the chatbox.

## 🎨 Customization

### **Modify Chatbot Responses**
To change the chatbot's behavior, edit the `script.js` file:

1. Open `chatbot/script.js` in a text editor.
2. Locate the predefined responses:
   ```javascript
   const responses = {
       "hello": "Hi there! How can I assist you today?",
       "how are you": "I'm just a chatbot, but I'm doing great! How about you?",
       "bye": "Goodbye! Have a great day! 😊"
   };
   ```
3. Add or modify responses as needed.

### **Change Chatbot Styling**
Edit `styles.css` to update the chatbot's appearance.
